## Assignment 2

*RMS*

`music` seem to have higher average of continuous signal than `speech`.

*Zero Crossings*

`speech` seem to have higher average of zero crossings than `music`, but `music` has higher variability.

*Peak-to-average Ratio*

Peak to average ratio (PAR) ranges from 3.7000 to 26.9150. `music` files tend to have lower PAR (close to 3.7) while `speech` files tend to spread itself the whole range.

PAR is likely the measure of the highest peak of the data compared to the average of the data. This makes sense because usually music has a similar volume throughout while speech data has lots of silence and then sudden data.

*Median Absolute Deviation*

Median absolute deviation (median AD) ranges from 0.0053 to 0.1300. `speech` files tend to have lower median AD (close to 0.0053), while `music` files tend to spread itself evenly from 0.0053 to 0.0680. 

Median AD is a robust measure of the variability or statistical dispersion of the data. In that sense, `music` data has higher variability.
